For more information visit here. - Focusing on the interface of fluid dynamics and epidemiology, the Bourouiba Group, in The Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory, aims to elucidate the fundamental physical mechanisms shaping the transmission dynamics of pathogens in human, animal, and plant populations where drops, bubbles, multiphase and complex flows are at the core. Key topics of research in the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory include: Pathogen-Fluid Interaction Interfacial flows: pathogen-fluid interactions in bubbles, drops and films Fluid fragmentation and droplet formation leading to air contamination Turbulence and multiphase flows Mixing, transport, and pathogen deposition and contamination Hydrodynamic instabilities and waves Viscoelastic and biological fluids Health, Disease Transmission Contact dynamics and pathogen transport Nosocomial diseases, respiratory diseases, waterborne diseases, and foliar diseases Disease transmission and contamination in indoor environments, including hospitals. We use a combination of theoretical (applied mathematics, including differential equations, linear algebra, nonlinear dynamics, waves and stability) and experimental approaches (flow visualization, high speed imaging techniques, microscopy, image processing) to elucidate the fundamental physical mechanisms of transmission of nosocomial diseases, respiratory diseases, waterborne diseases, and foliar diseases where fluids are ubiquitous and to design and formulate new control strategies.

We use tools from molecular, quantitative, and population genetics to identify the physiological basis of plant response to environmental cues, and ask how these mechanisms constrain or facilitate plant breeding and evolutionary change.

Importantly, the main challenge that we need to overcome to address the problem above is ecological uncertainty. That is, uncertainty about the exact equations governing the dynamics of ecological systems, together with the high uncertainty regarding the initial conditions, parameter values, intrinsic randomness, and more importantly, how the changing environmental conditions will affect all of these dynamics. To assess this uncertainty, we adopt a new approach we call structural ecology - a systematic and probabilistic approach rooted on the notion of structural stability to study ecological dynamics. Formally, a dynamical system is said to be structurally stable if the topology of the phase portrait is preserved under smooth changes of the vector field. Because is virtually impossible to know a priori all the changing biotic and biotic factors affecting the dynamics of biological populations, it is then necessary to quantify, from a probabilistic point of view (similar to quantum mechanics), the range of conditions compatible with their dynamics. In this line, the group develops novel parametric and nonparametric methods to estimate such probabilities and to be able to understand and predict the dynamics of ecological systems under environmental change.
